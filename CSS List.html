    <h1>HTML Lists and CSS List Properties</h1>
<pre class="pre1">
In HTML, there are two main types of lists:

    1. unordered lists (ul) - the list items are marked with bullets
    2. ordered lists (ol) - the list items are marked with numbers or letters
</pre>    
<br>
<br>

<h2>Different List Item Markers</h2>
<pre class="pre2">
  The list-style-type property specifies the type of list item marker.

    For Example:</pre>
    <p>Example of Unordered List</p>
    <ul class="A">
        <li>Milk</li>
        <li>Tea</li>
        <li>Coffee</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Example of Ordered List</p>
    <ol class="a">
        <li>Milk</li>
        <li>Tea</li>
        <li>Coffee</li>
    </ol>

    <br><br><br>

    <h2>An Image as The List Item Marker</h2>
    <pre class="pre2">
   The list-style-image property specifies an image as the list item marker:

     For Example:</pre>
    <p>Example of Ordered List</p>
    <ol class="B">
        <li>Apple</li>
        <li>Mango</li>
        <li>Strawberry</li>
    </ol>

        <li>Mango</li>
        <li>Strawberry</li>
    </ul>
    <br><br><br>

    <h2>Position The List Item Markers</h2>
