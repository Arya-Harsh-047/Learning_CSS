    <h2>Outline</h2>
    <pre class="pre1">
An outline is a line that is drawn around elements, OUTSIDE the borders, to make the element "stand out".

CSS has the following outline properties:

1. outline-style
2. outline-color
3. outline-width
4. outline-offset
5. outline
</pre
    >
    <br />
    <br />

    <h2>CSS Outline Style</h2>
    <pre class="pre2">
   The outline-style property specifies the style of the outline, and can have same value as border style.

      For Example:
    </pre>

    <p class="para">Demonstration of the different outline styles:</p>

    <br>
    <br>
    <br>

    <h2>Outline Width & color:</h2>
   <pre class="pre3">
   <ul><li>The outline-width property specifies the width of the outline, and can have one of the following values:
   thin (typically 1px)
   medium (typically 3px)
   thick (typically 5px)
   A specific size (in px, pt, cm, em, etc)</li>

   <li>The outline-color property is used to set the color of the outline.</li></ul>
   For Example:
   </pre>

    <p class="para2">
      The following example shows some outlines with different widths:
    </p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>

    <h2>CSS Outline Shorthand property</h2>
    <br>
    <div class="div1">
      The outline property is a shorthand property for setting the following individual outline properties:
    </div><br><br>

    <p class="para3">
      The outline property is specified as one, two, or three values from the list above. The order of the values does not matter.
    </p>

    <br>
    <br>
    <br>

   <h2>CSS Outline Offset</h2>
   <pre class="pre4">
   The outline-offset property adds space between an outline and the edge/border of an element. The space between an element and its outline is transparent.

   The following example shows that the space between an element and its outline is transparent:
    </pre>
    
    <p class="para4">
      This paragraph has an outline 15px outside the border edge.
    </p>
  </body>
</html>
