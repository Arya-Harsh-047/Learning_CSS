        <h1>CSS Transitions Property</h1>
        <br>
        <pre>
    To give smoothness to a animation or other activities we use Transition. To create a transition effect, you must specify two things:

        <li>the CSS property you want to add an effect</li>
        <li>the duration of the effect</li>
Note: If the duration part is not specified, the transition will have no effect, because the default value is 0.
        </pre>

    <br>
    <br>
    <br>

    <h2>1. Transition-Property:</h2>
    <br>
    <pre>
    The transition-property CSS property sets the CSS properties to which a transition effect should be applied.

    Example:
    </pre>

    <div id="tproperty">
            You can hover me to see the smoothness effect of transition property 
    </div>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>

    <h2>2. Transition-Duration:</h2>
    <br>
    <pre>
    The transition-duration CSS property sets the length of time a transition animation should take to complete.
    
    By default, the value is 0s, meaning that no animation will occur

    Example:
    </pre>

    <div id="tdproperty">
            You can hover me to see the smoothness effect of transition duration property with duration 1.5 second.
    </div>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>

    <h2>3. Transition Timing Function:</h2>
    <br>
    <pre>
    The transition-timing-function property specifies the speed curve of the transition effect.

    The transition-timing-function property can have the following values:
        
    → ease - specifies a transition effect with a slow start, then fast, then end slowly (this is default)

    → linear – specifies an evenly paced transition effect over the duration of the transition

    → ease-in - specifies a transition effect with a slow start
        
    → ease-out - specifies a transition effect with a slow end
        
    → ease-in-out - specifies a transition effect with a slow start and end
        
    → cubic-bezier(n,n,n,n) - lets you define your own values in a cubic-bezier function
    Example:
    </pre>

    <div id="tfunction">
            You can hover me to see the smoothness effect of transition duration property with duration 1.5 second.
    </div>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>

    <h2>4. Transition-Delay:</h2>
    <br>
    <pre>
        The transition-delay CSS property specifies the duration to wait before starting a property's transition effect when its value changes.

    Example:
    </pre>

    <div id="tdelay">
            You can hover me to see the smoothness effect of transition duration property after duration of 2 second.
    </div>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>

    <h2>4. Transition</h2>
    <br>
    <pre>
        The transition CSS property is a shorthand property for transition-property, transition-duration, transition-timing-function, and transition-delay.

    Example:
    </pre>

    <div id="transition">
            You can hover me to see the smoothness effect of transition 
    </div>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>

    </div>
</body>
